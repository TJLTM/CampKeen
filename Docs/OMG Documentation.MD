Introduction 

this project started with the lack of a way to monitor the systems within the RV I Have. this has lead to messes and headaches I no longer want to deal with and the fact that I'm somewhat smart (contrary to popular belief). I'm going to solve this problem with Electrical design and code. Mostly when I started this i wanted to be able to have a local system to monitor the various systems. NOw it's kind of grown into "I'm going to hook this up to xx so that i don't have to really do that much work and i can view it remotely". this is a mobile. techno nomad's dream come true. 

As I stated in the README. This is targeting my setup but if enough people like it then i'll work with you on getting your stuff setup. well until i loose interest if i'm not getting paid. Deal with it. but generally i'm pretty helpful because i enjoy this type of stuff. cause if i didn't i wouldn't be doing this.
